\f0\fs24 \cf0 Code and data developed by Chris Glaze (cmglaze@gmail.com) summer and fall 2016, presented at that year\'92s Society for Neuroscience conference. Data in poster based on collection up until 11/1/2016, current analysis based on data collected up to 12/20/16 so plots may look a little different.\
\
Each experimental session involved one of 3 stimulus sequences, and each subject was randomly assigned a session without replacement. Subjects participated in 1-3 sessions total.\
\
This guide has basic information on files and folders, with more specific information within each folder.\
\
A basic routine for updating data and re-analyzing:\
(1) update data files from the Ian&Kenan Dropbox folder\
(2) update behavioral analysis for all 3 stimulus sequences running behavioral_analysis.m\
(3) update pupil analysis for all 3 stimulus sequences running pupil_analysis.m\
(4) update individual differences analysis running indiff_anl.m\
(5) run SFN_plots.m\

FILE AND FOLDER DESCRIPTION:\
\
glaze_etal_SFN16_FINAL.pdf: poster, with right-most panels containing basic task analysis\
\
SFN_plots.m: main file generating figures in right panel with a number of supporting data files and subroutines. To understand code structure read SFN_plots.m and trace backwards.\
\
generate_model_vars.m: implementation of learning model on stimulus sequences to generate latent variables that can be compared with pupil diameter\
\
pupil_analysis.m: extracts pupil data from each session\
\
behavioral_analysis.m: initial fits of choice data to fixed-hazard rate by block model \
\
indiff_anl.m: initial stab at individual differences analysis looking for correlations between pupil diameter and different latent variables, and asking whether those correlations predict learning.\
\
stimPilot_auditory_2AFC_XXX.mat: files containing the 3 stimuli used for in the task. These were generated by \

Support functions you need to add to Matlab\'92s search path in order to use everything else.\

NOTES: \
\
-As of 12/20/16 a lot of variables are not explained in comments but the relevant ones may be apparent. Main result as of this date is a group-level effect in which normalized average pupil diameter over a trial appears to be strongly linked with changes in expected hazard rate, e.g. oscillatory data followed by a brief and sudden period of stability.\
\
-The individual differences analysis will require an estimate of learning subject by subject. CG\'92s first pass at this has failed to find a link between learning and the pupil effect but the initial estimate of learning needs a lot of work. In this data set a number of subjects appear to integrate hazard rate information over an entire session with a slowly evolving average rather than detecting sudden changes.\
\
-Stimulus sequences are stereotypes and each session included one of three (included here). The likelihood was manipulated along with hazard rate to control for overall prediction error, jumping to 1 as hazard rate ->0.4. The current learning model used to generate model information (particle_filter_learnH_learnlike.c) can adapt to this too.}
